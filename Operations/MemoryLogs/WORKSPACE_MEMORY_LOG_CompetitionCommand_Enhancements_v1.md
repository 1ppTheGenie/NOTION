# KEY DECISIONS MADE

## Product Definition

| Decision | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Target Audience | Invite-only. Top 10 agents per zip with proven market share. |
| Business Model | Subscription NOW → Transaction partnership FUTURE |
| Ultimate Goal | Drive LISTINGS and TRANSACTIONS, not just subscriptions |
| Parent Brand | Inspired Homes Network (eventually) |

## Area Ownership Rules

| Rule | Decision |
|------|----------|
| Exclusivity | One agent per zip code per property type |
| Property Type Split | Allowed (SFR vs Condo = different owners OK) |
| Multi-agent same zip/type | Not allowed |
| Future Partitioning | Architect for it, don't build yet |

## Waitlist Mechanics

| Rule | Decision |
|------|----------|
| Priority | First come, first served (admin can override) |
| Time Window | Configurable (start at 24 hours or less) |
| Deposit Option | $50 to hold spot |
| Auto-Accept | Checkbox option for instant grab |

## Pricing

| Tier | Price |
|------|-------|
| Single area | $500/month |
| Launch Bundle | 3-4 zips for $1,000 (6-12 months) |
| Goal | 100 agents at $1,000/month = $100K MRR |

## CTA Control

| Capability | SMS | Social |
|------------|:---:|:------:|
| Pick from menu | ❌ | ✅ |
| Customize text | ❌ | Maybe |
| Upload image | ❌ | ✅ |
| Template/style/color | ✅ | ✅ |

**Reason:** TCPA compliance - SMS must be community information, not promotion.

# PRODUCT LINEUP CLARIFIED

| Product | Type | Customization | Audience |
|---------|------|---------------|----------|
| **Competition Command** | Subscription (VIP) | Minimal | Invite-only |
| **Neighborhood Command** | Subscription | More | Anyone (via Paisley) |
| **Listing Command** | One-off | More | Anyone (via Paisley) |
| **GeoSocial** | Underlying tech | N/A | Built into all Commands |
| **Title Genie** | Distribution | N/A | Promotion channel for all |

## The Trifecta (Inspired Homes Network)

When an agent joins Competition Command, they get ALL THREE:
1. **Competition Command** - Circle prospecting on OTHER agents' listings (generic branding)
2. **Neighborhood Command** - Farming content (agent-branded)
3. **Listing Command** - Marketing agent's OWN listings (full branding)
