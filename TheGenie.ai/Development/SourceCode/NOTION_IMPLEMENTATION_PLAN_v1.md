## ✅ Cross-Linking in Notion

**YES! Notion supports cross-linking!**

### How It Works:

**1. Page Links**
- Link to any page from anywhere
- Example: Growth doc can link to Operations doc
- Click link → goes to that page

**2. Mentions**
- Mention pages in content
- Creates automatic link
- Shows page title and link

**3. Databases**
- Can have same item in multiple databases
- Link databases together
- Reference same content in different contexts

**4. Backlinks**
- Notion automatically tracks what links to a page
- See all pages that reference a doc
- Two-way linking

### Example:
```
Operations Report → Links to → Growth Strategy Doc
Growth Strategy Doc → Links back to → Operations Report
Both appear in each other's "Linked" section
```

**Result:** You can have collaboration docs that appear in both Operations and Growth sections!

- Workspace Memory

**Step 3: Set Up Private Vault**

## 🔒 Privacy Strategy (Simple)

### Default Rule:
**Everything is PUBLIC unless you mark it PRIVATE**

### How to Mark Private:
1. Create page in 🔒 Private Vault section
2. OR mark existing page as private (don't share it)
3. Simple as that!

### Private Sections:
- 🔒 Private Vault (top-level, only you)
  - Credentials
  - Personal Notes
  - Sensitive Business Data
  - ChatGPT Private Chats

### Can Move Later:
✅ **YES!** You can:
- Move pages between sections
- Change privacy settings
- Reorganize anytime
- Nothing is permanent

## 🎨 Design Decisions (Based on Your Answers)

### Structure:
- ✅ **Multi-business support** - Separate sections for each
- ✅ **Flexible** - Can reorganize anytime
- ✅ **Simple** - Start basic, expand as needed

### Privacy:
- ✅ **Default public** - Mark private as needed
- ✅ **Private Vault** - Central location for sensitive stuff
- ✅ **Flexible visibility** - Can hide, show locked, or show placeholder

### Access Control:
- ✅ **Decide later** - Start with just you
- ✅ **Can adjust** - Permissions can change anytime
- ✅ **Semi-private possible** - Can share specific sections with specific people

### Content Management:
- ✅ **Cursor has access** - Can read/write (we'll see how it works)
- ✅ **Flexible workflow** - Manual, AI-assisted, or automated
- ✅ **Cross-linking** - Docs can appear in multiple places
