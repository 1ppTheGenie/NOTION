## Recommendations

1. **Study Top Converters** - Rachael Hughel (91%), Pam Euker (85%), Jim Watson (67%) are hyperlocal experts
2. **Fix the Handoff** - Leads are generated but transition to agent is broken
3. **Implement Nurture Engine** - 61,311 leads still incubating need follow-up
4. **Soft CTAs** - Current CTAs are too aggressive, causing friction
