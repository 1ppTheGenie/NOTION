## 🚨 CRITICAL RULE

### NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER Save Files to C: Drive

**RULE:**
- ❌ **NEVER save files to C: drive**
- ❌ **NEVER write files to C: drive**
- ❌ **NEVER create files on C: drive**
- ✅ **ALL files must be on D: drive**

**Current Workspace Location:**
- ❌ **WRONG:** `C:\Cursor\TheGenie.ai\Development\TitleGenie`
- ✅ **CORRECT:** Should be on D: drive

**Why:**
- User has abandoned C: drive for D: drive
- All work must be on D: drive
- C: drive is NOT for file storage
